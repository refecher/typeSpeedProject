    "Brazil is the largest country in South America and the fifth largest nation in the world. It forms an enormous "
    "triangle on the eastern side of the continent with a 4,500-mile (7,400-kilometer) coastline along the Atlantic "
    "Ocean. It has borders with every South American country except Chile and Ecuador. ",

    "The Brazilian landscape is very varied. It is most well known for its dense forests, including the Amazon, "
    "the world's largest jungle, in the north. But there are also dry grasslands (called pampas), rugged hills, "
    "pine forests, sprawling wetlands, immense plateaus, and a long coastal plain. ",

    "Most Brazilians are descended from three ethnic groups: Amerindians, European settlers (mainly from Portugal), "
    "and Africans. Starting in the 19th century, waves of immigrants from Europe, the Middle East, and even Japan "
    "added to this mix. This diversity of cultures has created a rich religious, musical, and culinary culture. ",

    "Brazilians are soccer crazy, and their country has produced some of the best players. The most famous of all is "
    "Edson Arantes do Nascimento, better known as Pele. Brazil has won the World Cup soccer finals five times, "
    "more than any other nation. ",

    "Brazil has the greatest variety of animals of any country in the world. It is home to 600 mammal species, 1,"
    "500 fish species, 1,600 bird species, and an amazing 100,000 different types of insects. Brazil's jungles are "
    "home to most of its animal life, but many unique species also live in the pampas and semidesert regions. ",

    "Brazil has many different soils and climates, so it can produce a great variety of crops. Its agricultural "
    "exports include sugarcane, latex, coffee, cocoa beans, cotton, soybeans, rice, and tropical fruits. Brazil is "
    "also South America's most industrial nation, producing chemicals, steel, aircraft, and cars.",

    "Brazil was added to the map of the world during the great European explorations in the late 15th century led by "
    "Portugal and Spain. When Europeans first reached the coast of Brazil, the country was home to about 30 "
    "million indigenous people, or Amerindians. Today, only about 300,000 remain, living primarily in Brazil's "
    "remotest places.",

    "Portugal established its first colony in Brazil in 1530. Colonists created sugarcane plantations along the coast "
    "and sent diamonds and gold back to Europe. Soon, people from West Africa were brought to Brazil to work as "
    "slaves. The discovery of large inland gold reserves brought thousands of people from the coasts and as far away "
    "as Europe to the interior of the country."
