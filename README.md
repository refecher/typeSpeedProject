# Typing Speed Project
Using Tkinter in Python, this project builds a desktop app that assesses your typing speed. 

The test starts only when you start typing, and it ends when you complete the entire text. If you type some character wrong, the text will change its color to signal that a typo has occurred. When you fix the mistake, it will go back to its original color. By the end of the test, you will know ho many characters and words per minute you can type, as well as your accuracy.
